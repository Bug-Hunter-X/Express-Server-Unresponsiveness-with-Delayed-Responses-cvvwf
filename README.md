This repository demonstrates a common issue in Node.js Express servers where delayed responses can lead to unresponsiveness. The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code that introduces a 5-second delay.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution using request timeouts.  This is a simplified example to illustrate the problem, but the same can happen in more complex applications due to blocking operations, database queries, or external API calls within request handlers.
